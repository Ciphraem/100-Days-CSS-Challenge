This one actually took me a few days to complete *hehe...*

This was my first time animating something in CSS so here's what I studied:
- CSS Animation
- Cubic Bezier (even finding out about this [helpful tool](https://cubic-bezier.com/#.49,.02,.31,1.01))

I was also trying to copy the template and finding out why it worked. Really thankful for helpful documentation.

In the end, I'm happy with the result, but I know I can do better.

Here's an image of the finished work:
